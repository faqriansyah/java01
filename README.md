## About this repo

This is my java code repository when I was still learning, maybe it can be a reference and maybe it can be a memory if one day I succeed in becoming a programmer. 

I really appreciate those who have provided this learning resource, I learned from here :
1. Roadmap : https://roadmap.sh/java
2. W3schools : https://w3schools.com/java
3. JavatPoint : https://www.javatpoint.com/java-tutorial
4. Programmer zaman now - Tutorial Java (Indonesian) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiUxHm9l1KY&list=PL-CtdCApEFH-p_Q2GyK4K3ORoAT0Yt7CX&index=1
