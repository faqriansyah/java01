## About this repo

This is my java code repository when I was still learning, maybe it can be a reference and maybe it can be a memory if one day I succeed in becoming a programmer.üíª 

I really appreciate those who have provided this learning resourceüëè, I learned from here :
1. Roadmap : https://roadmap.sh/java
2. W3schools : https://w3schools.com/java
3. JavatPoint : https://www.javatpoint.com/java-tutorial
